# Face Generator
Small project to practice Gaussian distribution.

Using a variety of mouths, eyes, and hairstyles, randomly creates a new face every two seconds. Also uses Gaussian distribution to determine the y-pos of some of the face parts (ex: the eyes are on average found at y=-15, but it has a standard deviation of 5).

### Ways to improve code
* Very crude pictures
* Could use standard deviation on the x-axis. For example, the distance between the eyes can differ.
* Code could use some refactoring, but I kept it simple since it is a small project.
